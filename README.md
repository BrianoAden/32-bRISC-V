# 32bRISC-V
Hello! I created this repo to document my journey learning RISC-V Computer Architecture, and developing a soft processor in Verilog using everything I've learned! This is mainly to enhance my own learning, but I do hope this will be helpful to anybody who comes across it!

## Computer Architecture
In this section, I'll touch a bit on everything I've picked up about Computer Architecture on this journey!
### How Does a Computer do What it Does?
Computers are magical things. Truly! I don't mean to break your illusion, but how can we build impressive devices together if we're not familiar with the architecture and inner-workings of our template? 

Before we get super low-level with it, I'll show you a pretty high-level flowchart that aptly describes a computer's process!
